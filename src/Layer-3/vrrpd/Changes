0.4 - Sep 26th 2000
- written a man(8) page
- implemented the password authentication rfc2338.10.2 
  (not tested because i have a single computer :)
- change the state according to unix signal. USR1=be master, USR2=be backup
  pid stored in a file vrrpd_[IF]_[VRID].pid (e.g. vrrp_eth0_50.pid)
  WARNING: for guru only

0.3 - june 8th 2000
- add -n option. if it is set, vrrpd doesnt handle the virtual mac address.
  It isnt compliant to the rfc. but in practice it work and allow to have
  several virtual groups per interface (workaround the kernel assumption
  1 MAC per physical interface)
- fix a compilation problem with glibc-2.1.1 or below, MSG_TRUNC is undefined.
  reported by Hannes R. Boehm 

0.2 - may 18th 2000
- knowledgable comment and bug fix from Hannes R. Boehm 
	(VRRP_IS_BAD_PRIORITY, authentication field)
- gratuitous arp for non-vrrp addresses when the master becomes backup
- bug fix not to remove the primary address when the master is the address
  owner and become backup.
- no more depends on 'ip' from iproute tools. now netlink is used directly
  to set/remove the ip addresses.

0.1 - may 14th 2000
- release of the first version
