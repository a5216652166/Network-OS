Feature:
- launch a script according to the state change.
- add a test to set automatically the priority to 255 when the host
  own the ip addresses
- as vrrpd needs root access, audit the code security.
- test interoperability.
- code the plain text authentication and hardcode AH.
- make the master down interval tunable.
- work only with ethernet, all is hardcoded. it is ugly.
  see what you can do for fddi/tokenring -> problem i dont have the hardware
  so i can't test.
- beautifull the code.


- change the state according to unix signal USR1=be master, USR2=be backup
  pid stored in a file vrrpd_[IF]_[VRID].pid (e.g. vrrp_eth0_50.pid) DONE
- provide a mode in which you don't change the MAC address and thus support
  multiple virtual router per physical interface. DONE (-n)


Things to test:
- vrrpd vs commercial version
- vrrpd vs vrrpd
- multiple authentications (NONE,passwd, AH)
- checksum
